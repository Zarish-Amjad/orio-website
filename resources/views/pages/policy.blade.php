                            <p style="font-size: medium; font-family:'Montserrat'; color: white;">It is the
                                policy of
                                ORIO to prohibit and actively prevent money laundering and any
                                activity that facilitates money laundering or the funding of terrorist or
                                criminal activities
                                by complying with all applicable requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
                                and its
                                implementing regulations. <br><br>
                                Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or
                                disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the proceeds
                                appear to
                                have derived from legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets. Generally,
                                money
                                laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first enters the financial system at the
                                "placement"
                                stage, where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted into
                                monetary
                                instruments, such as money orders or traveler's checks, or deposited into
                                accounts at
                                financial institutions. At the "layering" stage, the funds are transferred or
                                moved into
                                other accounts or other financial institutions to further separate the money
                                from its
                                criminal origin. At the "integration" stage, the funds are reintroduced into the
                                economy
                                and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or
                                legitimate
                                businesses. <br><br>
                                Although cash is rarely deposited into securities accounts, the securities
                                industry is
                                unique in that it can be used to launder funds obtained elsewhere, and to
                                generate illicit
                                funds within the industry itself through fraudulent activities. Examples of
                                types of
                                fraudulent activities include insider trading, market manipulation, ponzi
                                schemes,
                                cybercrime and other investment-related fraudulent activity. <br>
                                Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather
                                an
                                attempt to conceal either the origin of the funds or their intended use, which
                                could be for
                                criminal purposes. Legitimate sources of funds are a key difference between
                                terrorist
                                financiers and traditional criminal organizations. In addition to charitable
                                donations,
                                legitimate sources include foreign government sponsors, business ownership and
                                personal
                                employment. Although the motivation differs between traditional money launderers
                                and
                                terrorist financiers, the actual methods used to fund terrorist operations can
                                be the same
                                as or similar to methods used by other criminals to launder funds. Funding for
                                terrorist
                                attacks does not always require large sums of money and the associated
                                transactions may
                                not be complex.

                                We will respond to a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) request

                                We understand that the receipt of a grand jury subpoena concerning a customer
                                does not
                                in itself require that we file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). When we
                                receive a

                                Based on the risk, and to the extent reasonable and practicable, we will ensure

                                have a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of our customers by

                                are available. In light of the increased instances of identity fraud, we will
                                supplement the
                                use of documentary evidence by using the non-documentary means described below
                                whenever necessary. We may also use non-documentary means, if we are still

                                We understand that we are not required to take steps to determine whether the

                                identity. If, however, we note that the document shows some obvious form of

                                must consider that factor in determining whether we can form a reasonable belief
                                that we
                                know the customer’s true identity.

                                We will use non-documentary methods of verification when: <br>
                                (1) the customer is unable to present an unexpired government-issued
                                identification

                                (2) ORIO is unfamiliar with the documents the customer presents for

                                (4) there are other circumstances that increase the risk that ORIO will be
                                unable to
                                verify the true identity of the customer through documentary means.<br>

                                enhanced due diligence that we will perform for each correspondent account will

                                at a minimum, procedures to take reasonable steps to:<br><br>
                                (1) conduct enhanced scrutiny of the correspondent account to guard against
                                money laundering and to identify and report any suspicious transactions.
                                Such scrutiny will not only reflect the risk assessment that is described in
                                Section 8.a. above, but will also include procedures to, as appropriate:<br><br>
                                (i) obtain (e.g., using a questionnaire) and consider information
                                related to the foreign bank’s AML program to assess the extent to
                                which the foreign bank’s correspondent account may expose us to
                                any risk of money laundering;<br><br>
                                (ii) monitor transactions to, from or through the correspondent account
                                in a manner reasonably designed to detect money laundering and
                                suspicious activity (this monitoring may be conducted manually or
                                electronically and may be done on an individual account basis or
                                by product activity); and<br><br>
                                (iii) obtain information from the foreign bank about the identity of any
                                person with authority to direct transactions through any
                                correspondent account that is a payable-through account (a
                                correspondent account maintained for a foreign bank through
                                which the foreign bank permits its customer to engage, either
                                directly or through a subaccount, in banking activities) and the
                                sources and beneficial owners of funds or other assets in the
                                payable-through account.<br><br>
                                (2) determine whether the foreign bank maintains correspondent accounts for
                                other foreign banks that enable those other foreign banks to gain access to
                                the correspondent account under review and, if so, to take reasonable steps to
                                obtain information to assess and mitigate the money laundering risks
                                associated with such accounts, including, as appropriate, the identity of
                                those other foreign banks; and <br><br>
                                (3) if the foreign bank’s shares are not publicly traded, determine the identity
                                of each owner and the nature and extent of each owner’s ownership
                                interest. We understand that for purposes of determining a private foreign
                                bank’s ownership, an “owner” is any person who directly or indirectly
                                owns, controls or has the power to vote 10 percent or more of any class of
                                securities of a foreign bank. We also understand that members of the same
                                family shall be considered to be one person.

                                account in the same or nearly the same amounts, especially when the origin and

                                with the customer’s business or history; the checks or money orders may
                                reference in
                                a memo section “investment” or “for purchase of stock.” This may be an indicator
                                of
                                a Ponzi scheme or potential funneling activity.<br>

                                We will report suspicious transactions by completing a SAR, and we will collect

                                the facts
                                that constitute a basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect is identified on the
                                date of initial
                                detection, we may delay filing the SAR for an additional 30 calendar days
                                pending
                                identification of a suspect, but in no case will the reporting be delayed more
                                than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection. The phrase “initial
                                detection” does not
                                mean the moment a transaction is highlighted for review. The 30-day (or 60-day)

                                begins when an appropriate review is conducted and a determination is made that

                                investigation.<br><br>

                                equivalent of
                                any supporting documentation for five years from the date of filing the SAR-SF.

                                have filed (and kept updated) the necessary annual certifications for such

                                Our training will include, at a minimum: (1) how to identify red flags and signs

                                risk is identified (including how, when and to whom to escalate unusual customer

            Firm Policy : </h4>
        <div class="content">
            <p style="color: white;">


                It is the policy of ORIO to prohibit and actively prevent money laundering and any
                activity that facilitates money laundering or the funding of terrorist or criminal activities
                by complying with all applicable requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its
                implementing regulations. <br><br>
                Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or
                disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the proceeds appear to
                have derived from legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets. Generally, money
                laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first enters the financial system at the "placement"
                stage, where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted into monetary
                instruments, such as money orders or traveler's checks, or deposited into accounts at
                financial institutions. At the "layering" stage, the funds are transferred or moved into
                other accounts or other financial institutions to further separate the money from its
                criminal origin. At the "integration" stage, the funds are reintroduced into the economy
                and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or legitimate
                businesses. <br><br>
                Although cash is rarely deposited into securities accounts, the securities industry is
                unique in that it can be used to launder funds obtained elsewhere, and to generate illicit
                funds within the industry itself through fraudulent activities. Examples of types of
                fraudulent activities include insider trading, market manipulation, ponzi schemes,
                cybercrime and other investment-related fraudulent activity. <br>
                Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an
                attempt to conceal either the origin of the funds or their intended use, which could be for
                criminal purposes. Legitimate sources of funds are a key difference between terrorist
                financiers and traditional criminal organizations. In addition to charitable donations,
                legitimate sources include foreign government sponsors, business ownership and personal
                employment. Although the motivation differs between traditional money launderers and
                terrorist financiers, the actual methods used to fund terrorist operations can be the same
                as or similar to methods used by other criminals to launder funds. Funding for terrorist
                attacks does not always require large sums of money and the associated transactions may
                not be complex.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our AML policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to ensure compliance
                with all applicable BSA regulations and FINRA rules and will be reviewed and updated
                on a regular basis to ensure appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls are in
                place to account for both changes in regulations and changes in our business.

            </h6>
            <p style="color: white;">


                We will respond to a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) request
                concerning accounts and transactions (a 314(a) Request) by immediately searching our
                records to determine whether we maintain or have maintained any account for, or have
                engaged in any transaction with, each individual, entity or organization named in the
                314(a) Request as outlined in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) located on
                FinCEN’s secure website. We understand that we have 14 days (unless otherwise
                specified by FinCEN) from the transmission date of the request to respond to a 314(a)
                Request. We will designate through the FINRA Contact System (FCS) one or more
                persons to be the point of contact (POC) for 314(a) Requests and will promptly update
                the POC information following any change in such information. (See also Section 2
                above regarding updating of contact information for the AML Compliance Person.)
                Unless otherwise stated in the 314(a) Request or specified by FinCEN, we are required to
                search those documents outlined in FinCEN’s FAQ. If we find a match, Wilfried Kouadio
                will report it to FinCEN via FinCEN’s Web-based 314(a) Secure Information Sharing
                System within 14 days or within the time requested by FinCEN in the request. If the
                search parameters differ from those mentioned above (for example, if FinCEN limits the
                search to a geographic location), Wilfried Kouadio will structure our search accordingly
                <br><br>
                If Wilfried Kouadio searches our records and does not find a matching account or
                transaction, then Wilfried Kouadio will not reply to the 314(a) Request. We will maintain
                documentation that we have performed the required search.

                <br><br>
                We will not disclose the fact that FinCEN has requested or obtained information from us,
                except to the extent necessary to comply with the information request. Wilfried Kouadio
                will review, maintain and implement procedures to protect the security and
                confidentiality of requests from FinCEN similar to those procedures established to satisfy
                the requirements of Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act with regard to the
                protection of customers’ nonpublic information.
                <br><br>
                We will direct any questions we have about the 314(a) Request to the requesting federal
                law enforcement agency as designated in the request.
                <br><br>
                Unless otherwise stated in the 314(a) Request, we will not be required to treat the
                information request as continuing in nature, and we will not be required to treat the
                periodic 314(a) Requests as a government provided list of suspected terrorists for
                purposes of the customer identification and verification requirements.

            <p style="color: white;">


                We understand that the receipt of a National Security Letter (NSL) is highly confidential.
                We understand that none of our officers, employees or agents may directly or indirectly
                disclose to any person that the FBI or other federal government authority has sought or
                obtained access to any of our records. To maintain the confidentiality of any NSL we
                receive, we will process and maintain the NSL. If we file a SAR after receiving an NSL,
                the SAR will not contain any reference to the receipt or existence of the NSL. The SAR
                will only contain detailed information about the facts and circumstances of the detected
                suspicious activity.

                We understand that the receipt of a grand jury subpoena concerning a customer does not
                in itself require that we file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). When we receive a
                grand jury subpoena, we will conduct a risk assessment of the customer subject to the
                subpoena as well as review the customer’s account activity. If we uncover suspicious
                activity during our risk assessment and review, we will elevate that customer’s risk
                assessment and file a SAR in accordance with the SAR filing requirements. We
                understand that none of our officers, employees or agents may directly or indirectly
                disclose to the person who is the subject of the subpoena its existence, its contents or the
                information we used to respond to it. To maintain the confidentiality of any grand jury
                subpoena we receive, we will process and maintain the subpoena as required. If we file a
                SAR after receiving a grand jury subpoena, the SAR will not contain any reference to the
                receipt or existence of the subpoena. The SAR will only contain detailed information
                about the facts and circumstances of the detected suspicious activity.

                Institutions

            </h6>
            <p style="color: white;">


                We will share information with other financial institutions regarding individuals, entities,
                organizations and countries for purposes of identifying and, where appropriate, reporting
                activities that we suspect may involve possible terrorist activity or money laundering.
                Wilfried Kouadio will ensure that ORIO files with FinCEN an initial notice before any
                sharing occurs and annual notices thereafter. We will use the notice form found at
                FinCEN’s website. Before we share information with another financial institution, we
                will take reasonable steps to verify that the other financial institution has submitted the
                requisite notice to FinCEN, either by obtaining confirmation from the financial institution
                or by consulting a list of such financial institutions that FinCEN will make available. We
                understand that this requirement applies even to financial institutions with which we are
                affiliated, and that we will obtain the requisite notices from affiliates and follow all
                required procedures
                <br><br>
                We will employ strict procedures both to ensure that only relevant information is shared
                and to protect the security and confidentiality of this information, for example, by
                segregating it from ORIO’s other books and records.
                <br><br>
                We also will employ procedures to ensure that any information received from another
                financial institution shall not be used for any purpose other than:
                <br><br>
                ● identifying and, where appropriate, reporting on money laundering or terrorist
                activities;
                <br><br>
                ● determining whether to establish or maintain an account, or to engage in a
                transaction; or
                <br><br>
                ● assisting the financial institution in complying with performing such activities.

                that are prohibited by the economic sanctions and embargoes administered and enforced
                by OFAC. (See the OFAC website for the SDN list and listings of current sanctions and
                embargoes). Because the SDN list and listings of economic sanctions and embargoes are
                updated frequently, we will consult them on a regular basis and subscribe to receive any
                available updates when they occur. With respect to the SDN list, we may also access that
                list through various software programs to ensure speed and accuracy. See also FINRA’s
                OFAC Search Tool that screens names against the SDN list. Wilfried Kouadio will also
                review existing accounts against the SDN list and listings of current sanctions and
                embargoes when they are updated and he will document the review.<br><br>
                If we determine that a customer is on the SDN list or is engaging in transactions that are
                prohibited by the economic sanctions and embargoes administered and enforced by
                OFAC, we will reject the transaction and/or block the customer's assets and file a blocked
                assets and/or rejected transaction form with OFAC within 10 days. We will also call the
                OFAC Hotline at (800) 540-6322 immediately.<br><br>
                Our review will include customer accounts, transactions involving customers (including
                activity that passes through ORIO such as wires) and the review of customer transactions
                that involve physical security certificates or application-based investments (e.g., mutual
                funds).

            <p style="color: white;">


                Prior to opening an account, Wilfried Kouadio will collect the following information for
                all accounts, if applicable, for any person, entity or organization that is opening a new
                account and whose name is on the account: <br>
                (1) the name; <br>
                (2) date of birth (for an individual);<br>
                (3) an address, which will be a residential or business street address (for an
                individual), an Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number,
                or residential or business street address of next of kin or another contact
                individual (for an individual who does not have a residential or business street
                address), or a principal place of business, local office, or other physical location
                (for a person other than an individual); and<br>

                (4) an identification number, which will be a taxpayer identification number (for U.S.
                persons), or one or more of the following: a taxpayer identification number,
                passport number and country of issuance, alien identification card number, or
                number and country of issuance of any other government-issued document
                evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or other similar
                safeguard (for non-U.S. persons).
                <br>
                <br>
                In the event that a customer has applied for, but has not received, a taxpayer
                identification number, we will confirm that the application was filed before the customer
                opens the account and to obtain the taxpayer identification number within a reasonable
                period of time after the account is opened.
                <br><br>
                When opening an account for a foreign business or enterprise that does not have an
                identification number, we will request alternative government-issued documentation
                certifying the existence of the business or enterprise.

            <h6 style="color: white; margin-top:15px; ">b. Customers Who Refuse to Provide
                Information

            </h6>
            <p style="color: white;">
                If a potential or existing customer either refuses to provide the information described
                above when requested, or appears to have intentionally provided misleading information,
                our firm will not open a new account and, after considering the risks involved, consider
                closing any existing account. In either case, our AML Compliance Person will be notified
                so that we can determine whether we should report the situation to FinCEN on a SAR.

            </p>

            <h6 style="color: white; margin-top:15px;">c. Verifying Information


            </h6>
            <p style="color: white;">
                Based on the risk, and to the extent reasonable and practicable, we will ensure that we
                have a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of our customers by using
                risk-based procedures to verify and document the accuracy of the information we get
                about our customers. Wilfried Kouadio will analyze the information we obtain to
                determine whether the information is sufficient to form a reasonable belief that we know
                the true identity of the customer (e.g., whether the information is logical or contains
                inconsistencies).
                <br><br>
                We will verify customer identity through documentary means, non-documentary means
                or both. We will use documents to verify customer identity when appropriate documents
                are available. In light of the increased instances of identity fraud, we will supplement the
                use of documentary evidence by using the non-documentary means described below
                whenever necessary. We may also use non-documentary means, if we are still uncertain
                about whether we know the true identity of the customer. In verifying the information, we
                will consider whether the identifying information that we receive, such as the customer’s
                name, street address, zip code, telephone number (if provided), date of birth and Social
                Security number, allow us to determine that we have a reasonable belief that we know the
                true identity of the customer (e.g., whether the information is logical or contains
                inconsistencies).
                <br><br>
                Appropriate documents for verifying the identity of customers include the following:
                <br><br>
                ● For an individual, an unexpired government-issued identification evidencing
                nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard, such as a
                driver’s license or passport; and

                <br><br>
                ● For a person other than an individual, documents showing the existence of the
                entity, such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued business
                license, a partnership agreement or a trust instrument.
                <br><br>
                We understand that we are not required to take steps to determine whether the document
                that the customer has provided to us for identity verification has been validly issued and
                that we may rely on a government-issued identification as verification of a customer’s
                identity. If, however, we note that the document shows some obvious form of fraud, we
                must consider that factor in determining whether we can form a reasonable belief that we
                know the customer’s true identity.
                <br><br>
                We will use the following non-documentary methods of verifying identity:
                <br><br>
                ● Independently verifying the customer’s identity through the comparison of
                information provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer
                reporting agency, public database or other;
                <br><br>
                ● Checking references with other financial institutions; or
                <br><br>
                ● Obtaining a financial statement.
                <br><br>
                We will use non-documentary methods of verification when: <br>
                (1) the customer is unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification
                document with a photograph or other similar safeguard;<br>
                (2) ORIO is unfamiliar with the documents the customer presents for identification
                verification;<br>
                (3) the customer and firm do not have face-to-face contact; and<br>
                (4) there are other circumstances that increase the risk that ORIO will be unable to
                verify the true identity of the customer through documentary means.<br>

                <br>
                We will verify the information within a reasonable time before or after the account is
                opened. Depending on the nature of the account and requested transactions, we may
                refuse to complete a transaction before we have verified the information, or in some
                instances when we need more time, we may, pending verification, restrict the types of
                transactions or dollar amount of transactions. If we find suspicious information that
                indicates possible money laundering, terrorist financing activity, or other suspicious
                activity, we will, after internal consultation with ORIO's AML Compliance Person, file a
                SAR in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
                <br><br>
                We recognize that the risk that we may not know the customer’s true identity may be
                heightened for certain types of accounts, such as an account opened in the name of a
                corporation, partnership or trust that is created or conducts substantial business in a
                jurisdiction that has been designated by the U.S. as a primary money laundering
                jurisdiction, a terrorist concern, or has been designated as a non-cooperative country or
                territory. We will identify customers that pose a heightened risk of not being properly
                identified.

            </h6>
            <p style="color: white;">
                When we cannot form a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of a
                customer, we will do the following: (1) not open an account; (2) impose terms
                under which a customer may conduct transactions while we attempt to verify the
                customer’s identity; (3) close an account after attempts to verify a customer’s
                identity fail; and (4) determine whether it is necessary to file a SAR in accordance
                with applicable laws and regulations.

            <h6 style="color: white; margin-top:15px; ">e. Recordkeeping

            </h6>

                We will document our verification, including all identifying information provided by a
                customer, the methods used and results of verification, and the resolution of any
                discrepancies identified in the verification process. We will keep records containing a
                description of any document that we relied on to verify a customer’s identity, noting the
                type of document, any identification number contained in the document, the place of
                issuance, and if any, the date of issuance and expiration date. With respect to
                non-documentary verification, we will retain documents that describe the methods and
                the results of any measures we took to verify the identity of a customer. We will also
                keep records containing a description of the resolution of each substantive discrepancy
                discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained. We will retain records of
                all identification information for five years after the account has been closed; we will
                retain records made about verification of the customer's identity for five years after the
                record is made.

                At such time as we receive notice that a federal government agency has issued a list of
                known or suspected terrorists and identified the list as a list for CIP purposes, we will,
                within a reasonable period of time after an account is opened (or earlier, if required by
                another federal law or regulation or federal directive issued in connection with an
                applicable list), determine whether a customer appears on any such list of known or
                suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any federal government agency
                and designated as such by Treasury in consultation with the federal functional regulators.
                We will follow all federal directives issued in connection with such lists.

                When we receive a written request from a federal law enforcement officer for
                information identifying the non-publicly traded owners of any foreign bank for which we
                maintain a correspondent account in the United States and/or the name and address of a
                person residing in the United States who is an agent to accept service of legal process for
                a foreign bank’s correspondent account, we will provide that information to the
                requesting officer not later than seven days after receipt of the request. We will close,
                within 10 days, any correspondent account for a foreign bank that we learn from FinCEN
                or the Department of Justice has failed to comply with a summons or subpoena issued by
                the Secretary of the Treasury or the Attorney General of the United States or has failed to

                activity during that 10-day period to ensure that any suspicious activity is appropriately
                reported and to ensure that no new positions are established in these correspondent

                Institutions


            </h6>
            <p style="color: white;">

                We will conduct an inquiry to determine whether a foreign financial institution has a
                correspondent account established, maintained, administered or managed by ORIO.
                <br>
                If we have correspondent accounts for foreign financial institutions, we will assess the
                money laundering risk posed, based on a consideration of relevant risk factors. We can
                apply all or a subset of these risk factors depending on the nature of the foreign financial
                institutions and the relative money laundering risk posed by such institutions.<br>
                The relevant risk factors can include:<br>
                ● the nature of the foreign financial institution’s business and the markets it
                serves;<br>
                ● the type, purpose and anticipated activity of such correspondent account;<br>
                ● the nature and duration of ORIO’s relationship with the foreign financial
                institution and its affiliates;<br>
                ● the anti-money laundering and supervisory regime of the jurisdiction that
                issued the foreign financial institution’s charter or license and, to the
                extent reasonably available, the jurisdiction in which any company that is
                an owner of the foreign financial institution is incorporated or chartered;
                and<br>
                ● information known or reasonably available to the covered financial
                institution about the foreign financial institution’s anti-money laundering
                record.<br>
                In addition, our due diligence program will consider additional factors that have not been
                enumerated above when assessing foreign financial institutions that pose a higher risk of
                money laundering.<br>
                We will apply our risk-based due diligence procedures and controls to each financial
                foreign institution correspondent account on an ongoing basis. This includes periodically
                reviewing the activity of each foreign financial institution correspondent sufficient to
                ensure whether the nature and volume of account activity is generally consistent with the
                information regarding the purpose and expected account activity and to ensure that ORIO
                can adequately identify suspicious transactions. Ordinarily, we will not conduct this
                periodic review by scrutinizing every transaction taking place within the account. One
                procedure we may use instead is to use any account profiles for our correspondent
                accounts (to the extent we maintain these) that we ordinarily use to anticipate how the
                account might be used and the expected volume of activity to help establish baselines for
                detecting unusual activity.

            </h6>
            <p style="color: white;">
                We will assess any correspondent accounts for foreign financial institutions to determine
                whether they are correspondent accounts that have been established, maintained,
                administered or managed for any foreign bank that operates under:<br><br>
                (1) an offshore banking license;<br><br>
                (2) a banking license issued by a foreign country that has been designated as
                non-cooperative with international anti-money laundering principles or
                procedures by an intergovernmental group or organization of which the United
                States is a member and with which designation the U.S. representative to the
                group or organization concurs; or<br><br>
                (3) a banking license issued by a foreign country that has been designated by the
                Secretary of the Treasury as warranting special measures due to money
                laundering concerns.<br><br>
                If we determine that we have any correspondent accounts for these specified foreign
                banks, we will perform enhanced due diligence on these correspondent accounts. The
                enhanced due diligence that we will perform for each correspondent account will include,
                at a minimum, procedures to take reasonable steps to:<br><br>
                (1) conduct enhanced scrutiny of the correspondent account to guard against
                money laundering and to identify and report any suspicious transactions.
                Such scrutiny will not only reflect the risk assessment that is described in
                Section 8.a. above, but will also include procedures to, as appropriate:<br><br>
                (i) obtain (e.g., using a questionnaire) and consider information
                related to the foreign bank’s AML program to assess the extent to
                which the foreign bank’s correspondent account may expose us to
                any risk of money laundering;<br><br>
                (ii) monitor transactions to, from or through the correspondent account
                in a manner reasonably designed to detect money laundering and
                suspicious activity (this monitoring may be conducted manually or
                electronically and may be done on an individual account basis or
                by product activity); and<br><br>
                (iii) obtain information from the foreign bank about the identity of any
                person with authority to direct transactions through any
                correspondent account that is a payable-through account (a
                correspondent account maintained for a foreign bank through
                which the foreign bank permits its customer to engage, either
                directly or through a subaccount, in banking activities) and the
                sources and beneficial owners of funds or other assets in the
                payable-through account.<br><br>
                (2) determine whether the foreign bank maintains correspondent accounts for
                other foreign banks that enable those other foreign banks to gain access to
                the correspondent account under review and, if so, to take reasonable steps to obtain information to
                assess and mitigate the money laundering risks
                associated with such accounts, including, as appropriate, the identity of
                those other foreign banks; and <br><br>
                (3) if the foreign bank’s shares are not publicly traded, determine the identity
                of each owner and the nature and extent of each owner’s ownership
                interest. We understand that for purposes of determining a private foreign
                bank’s ownership, an “owner” is any person who directly or indirectly
                owns, controls or has the power to vote 10 percent or more of any class of
                securities of a foreign bank. We also understand that members of the same
                family shall be considered to be one person.

                    ● An account is opened by a non-profit organization that provides services in
                    geographic locations known to be at higher risk for being an active terrorist threat.<br>
                    ● An account is opened in the name of a legal entity that is involved in the activities of
                    an association, organization or foundation whose aims are related to the claims or
                    demands of a known terrorist entity.<br>
                    ● An account is opened for a purported stock loan company, which may hold the

                    behalf of customers.<br>
                    ● An account is opened for a foreign financial institution that is affiliated with a U.S.
                    broker-dealer, bypassing its U.S. affiliate, for no apparent business purpose. An
                    apparent business purpose could include access to products or services the U.S.

                <p style="color: white;">
                    ● The customer attempts or makes frequent or large deposits of currency, insists on
                    dealing only in cash equivalents, or asks for exemptions from ORIO’s policies and
                    procedures relating to the deposit of cash and cash equivalents. <br>
                    ● The customer “structures” deposits, withdrawals or purchases of monetary
                    instruments below a certain amount to avoid reporting or recordkeeping requirements,
                    and may state directly that they are trying to avoid triggering a reporting obligation or
                    to evade taxing authorities.<br>
                    ● The customer seemingly breaks funds transfers into smaller transfers to avoid raising
                    attention to a larger funds transfer. The smaller funds transfers do not appear to be
                    based on payroll cycles, retirement needs, or other legitimate regular deposit and
                    withdrawal strategies.<br>
                    ● The customer’s account shows numerous currency, money order (particularly
                    sequentially numbered money orders) or cashier’s check transactions aggregating to
                    significant sums without any apparent business or lawful purpose.<br>
                    ● The customer frequently changes bank account details or information for redemption
                    proceeds, in particular when followed by redemption requests.<br>
                    ● The customer makes a funds deposit followed by an immediate request that the
                    money be wired out or transferred to a third party, or to another firm, without any
                    apparent business purpose.<br>
                    ● Wire transfers are made in small amounts in an apparent effort to avoid triggering
                    identification or reporting requirements.<br>
                    ● Incoming payments are made by third-party checks or checks with multiple
                    endorsements.<br>
                    ● Outgoing checks to third parties coincide with, or are close in time to, incoming
                    checks from other third parties.<br>
                    ● Payments are made by third party check or money transfer from a source that has no
                    apparent connection to the customer.<br>
                    ● Wire transfers are made to or from financial secrecy havens, tax havens, high-risk
                    geographic locations or conflict zones, including those with an established presence
                    of terrorism.<br>
                    ● Wire transfers originate from jurisdictions that have been highlighted in relation to
                    black market peso exchange activities.<br>
                    ● The customer engages in transactions involving foreign currency exchanges that are
                    followed within a short time by wire transfers to locations of specific concern (e.g.,
                    countries designated by national authorities, such as FATF, as non-cooperative
                    countries and territories).<br>
                    ● The parties to the transaction (e.g., originator or beneficiary) are from countries that
                    are known to support terrorist activities and organizations.<br>
                    ● Wire transfers or payments are made to or from unrelated third parties (foreign or
                    domestic), or where the name or account number of the beneficiary or remitter has
                    not been supplied.<br>
                    ● There is wire transfer activity that is unexplained, repetitive, unusually large, shows
                    unusual patterns or has no apparent business purpose.<br>
                    ● The securities account is used for payments or outgoing wire transfers with little or no
                    securities activities (i.e., account appears to be used as a depository account or a
                    conduit for transfers, which may be purported to be for business operating needs).<br>
                    ● Funds are transferred to financial or depository institutions other than those from
                    which the funds were initially received, specifically when different countries are
                    involved.<br>
                    ● The customer engages in excessive journal entries of funds between related or
                    unrelated accounts without any apparent business purpose.<br>
                    ● The customer uses a personal/individual account for business purposes or vice versa.<br>
                    ● A foreign import business with U.S. accounts receives payments from outside the
                    area of its customer base.<br>
                    ● There are frequent transactions involving round or whole dollar amounts purported to
                    involve payments for goods or services.<br>
                    ● Upon request, a customer is unable or unwilling to produce appropriate
                    documentation (e.g., invoices) to support a transaction, or documentation appears
                    doctored or fake (e.g., documents contain significant discrepancies between the
                    descriptions on the transport document or bill of lading, the invoice, or other
                    documents such as the certificate of origin or packing list).<br>
                    ● The customer requests that certain payments be routed through nostro 14
                    or
                    correspondent accounts held by the financial intermediary instead of its own
                    accounts, for no apparent business purpose.<br>
                    ● Funds are transferred into an account and are subsequently transferred out of the
                    account in the same or nearly the same amounts, especially when the origin and
                    destination locations are high-risk jurisdictions.<br>
                    ● A dormant account suddenly becomes active without a plausible explanation (e.g.,
                    large deposits that are suddenly wired out).<br>
                    ● Nonprofit or charitable organizations engage in financial transactions for which there
                    appears to be no logical economic purpose or in which there appears to be no link
                    between the stated activity of the organization and the other parties in the transaction.
                    ● There is unusually frequent domestic and international automated teller machine
                    (ATM) activity.<br>
                    ● A person customarily uses the ATM to make several deposits into a brokerage
                    account below a specified BSA/AML reporting threshold.<br>
                    ● Many small, incoming wire transfers or deposits are made using checks and money
                    orders that are almost immediately withdrawn or wired out in a manner inconsistent
                    with the customer’s business or history; the checks or money orders may reference in
                    a memo section “investment” or “for purchase of stock.” This may be an indicator of
                    a Ponzi scheme or potential funneling activity.<br>
                    ● Wire transfer activity, when viewed over a period of time, reveals suspicious or
                    unusual patterns, which could include round dollar, repetitive transactions or
                    circuitous money movements.<br>

                <p style="color: white;">
                    The customer is reluctant to provide information needed to file reports to proceed
                    with the transaction.<br>
                    ● The customer exhibits unusual concern with ORIO’s compliance with government
                    reporting requirements and ORIO’s AML policies.<br>
                    ● The customer tries to persuade an employee not to file required reports or not to
                    maintain the required records.<br>
                    ● Notifications received from the broker-dealer’s clearing firm that the clearing firm
                    had identified potentially suspicious activity in customer accounts. Such notifications
                    can take the form of alerts or other concern regarding negative news, money
                    movements or activity involving certain securities.<br>
                    ● Law enforcement has issued subpoenas or freeze letters regarding a customer or
                    account at the securities firm.<br>
                    ● The customer makes high-value transactions not commensurate with the customer’s
                    known income or financial resources.<br>
                    ● The customer wishes to engage in transactions that lack business sense or an apparent
                    investment strategy, or are inconsistent with the customer’s stated business strategy.<br>
                    ● The stated business, occupation or financial resources of the customer are not
                    commensurate with the type or level of activity of the customer.<br>
                    ● The customer engages in transactions that show the customer is acting on behalf of
                    third parties with no apparent business or lawful purpose.<br>
                    ● The customer engages in transactions that show a sudden change inconsistent with
                    normal activities of the customer.<br>
                    ● Securities transactions are unwound before maturity, absent volatile market
                    conditions or other logical or apparent reason.<br>
                    ● The customer does not exhibit a concern with the cost of the transaction or fees (e.g.,
                    surrender fees, or higher than necessary commissions).<br>
                    ● A borrower defaults on a cash-secured loan or any loan that is secured by assets that
                    are readily convertible into currency.<br>
                    ● There is an unusual use of trust funds in business transactions or other financial

                    We will file SARs with FinCEN for any transactions (including deposits and transfers)
                    conducted or attempted by, at or through our firm involving $5,000 or more of funds or
                    assets (either individually or in the aggregate) where we know, suspect or have reason to
                    suspect:<br>
                    (1) the transaction involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended or
                    conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activity
                    as part of a plan to violate or evade federal law or regulation or to avoid any
                    transaction reporting requirement under federal law or regulation;<br>
                    (2) the transaction is designed, whether through structuring or otherwise, to evade any
                    requirements of the BSA regulations;<br>
                    (3) the transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in
                    which the customer would normally be expected to engage, and after examining
                    the background, possible purpose of the transaction and other facts, we know of
                    no reasonable explanation for the transaction; or<br>
                    (4) the transaction involves the use of ORIO to facilitate criminal activity.
                    We will also file a SAR and notify the appropriate law enforcement authority in
                    situations involving violations that require immediate attention, such as terrorist
                    financing or ongoing money laundering schemes. In addition, although we are not
                    required to, we may contact that SEC in cases where a SAR we have filed may require
                    immediate attention by the SEC. See Section 11 for contact numbers. We also understand
                    that, even if we notify a regulator of a violation, unless it is specifically covered by one of
                    the exceptions in the SAR rule, we must file a SAR reporting the violation.<br><br>
                    We may file a voluntary SAR for any suspicious transaction that we believe is relevant to
                    the possible violation of any law or regulation but that is not required to be reported by us
                    under the SAR rule. It is our policy that all SARs will be reported regularly to the Board
                    of Directors and appropriate senior management, with a clear reminder of the need to
                    maintain the confidentiality of the SAR.<br><br>
                    We will report suspicious transactions by completing a SAR, and we will collect and
                    maintain supporting documentation as required by the BSA regulations. We will file a
                    SAR-SF no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of the facts
                    that constitute a basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect is identified on the date of initial
                    detection, we may delay filing the SAR for an additional 30 calendar days pending
                    identification of a suspect, but in no case will the reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days
                    after the date of initial detection. The phrase “initial detection” does not
                    mean the moment a transaction is highlighted for review. The 30-day (or 60-day) period
                    begins when an appropriate review is conducted and a determination is made that the
                    transaction under review is “suspicious” within the meaning of the SAR requirements. A
                    review must be initiated promptly upon identification of unusual activity that warrants
                    investigation.<br><br>
                    We will retain copies of any SAR filed and the original or business record equivalent of
                    any supporting documentation for five years from the date of filing the SAR-SF. We will
                    identify and maintain supporting documentation and make such information available to
                    FinCEN, any other appropriate law enforcement agencies, federal or state securities
                    regulators or SROs upon request.<br><br>
                    We will not notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been
                    reported, except as permitted by the BSA regulations. We understand that anyone who is
                    subpoenaed or required to disclose a SAR or the information contained in the SAR will,
                    except where disclosure is requested by FinCEN, the SEC, or another appropriate law
                    enforcement or regulatory agency, or an SRO registered with the SEC, decline to produce
                    the SAR or to provide any information that would disclose that a SAR was prepared or

                    name and address of the transmittor; (2) if the payment is ordered from an account, the
                    account number; (3) the amount of the transmittal order; (4) the execution date of the
                    transmittal order; and (5) the identity of the recipient’s financial institution. In addition,
                    we will include on the transmittal order as many of the following items of information as
                    are received with the transmittal order: (1) the name and address of the recipient; (2) the
                    account number of the recipient; (3) any other specific identifier of the recipient; and (4)
                    any form relating to the transmittal of funds that is completed or signed by the person
                    placing the transmittal order.
                    <br><br>
                    We will also verify the identity of the person placing the transmittal order (if we are the
                    transmitting firm), provided the transmittal order is placed in person and the transmittor is
                    not an established customer of ORIO (i.e., a customer of ORIO who has not previously
                    maintained an account with us or for whom we have not obtained and maintained a file
                    with the customer's name, address, taxpayer identification number, or, if none, alien
                    identification number or passport number and country of issuance). If a transmittor or
                    recipient is conducting business in person, we will obtain: (1) the person’s name and
                    address; (2) the type of identification reviewed and the number of the identification
                    document (e.g., driver’s license); and (3) the person’s taxpayer identification number (e.g., Social
                    Security or employer identification number) or, if none, alien identification
                    number or passport number and country of issuance, or a notation in the record the lack
                    thereof. If a transmittor or recipient is not conducting business in person, we shall obtain
                    the person’s name, address, and a copy or record of the method of payment (e.g., check
                    or credit card transaction). In the case of transmittors only, we shall also obtain the
                    transmittor’s taxpayer identification number (e.g., Social Security or employer
                    identification number) or, if none, alien identification number or passport number and
                    country of issuance, or a notation in the record of the lack thereof. In the case of
                    recipients only, we shall obtain the name and address of the person to which the
                    transmittal was sent.

                Our AML Compliance Person and his or her designee will be responsible for ensuring
                that AML records are maintained properly and that SARs are filed as required. <br><br>
                In addition, as part of our AML program, our firm will create and maintain SARs, CTRs,
                CMIRs, FBARs, and relevant documentation on customer identity and verification (See
                Section 5 above) and funds transmittals. We will maintain SARs and their accompanying
                documentation for at least five years. We will keep other documents according to existing
                BSA and other recordkeeping requirements, including certain SEC rules that require
                six-year retention periods (e.g., Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(a) requiring firms to preserve
                for a period of not less than six years, all records required to be retained by Exchange Act
                Rule 17a-3(a)(1)-(3), (a)(5), and (a)(21)-(22) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(e)(5)
                requiring firms to retain for six years account record information required pursuant to

                </h6>
                <br>
                We will hold SARs and any supporting documentation confidential. We will not inform
                anyone outside of FinCEN, the SEC, an SRO registered with the SEC or other
                appropriate law enforcement or regulatory agency about a SAR. We will refuse any
                subpoena requests for SARs or for information that would disclose that a SAR has been
                prepared or filed and immediately notify FinCEN of any such subpoena requests that we
                receive. See Section 11 for contact numbers. We will segregate SAR filings and copies of
                supporting documentation from other firm books and records to avoid disclosing SAR
                filings. Our AML Compliance Person will handle all subpoenas or other requests for
                SARs. We may share information with another financial institution about suspicious
                transactions in order to determine whether we will jointly file a SAR according to the
                provisions of Section 3.d. In cases in which we file a joint SAR for a transaction that has
                been handled both by us and another financial institution, both financial institutions will
                maintain a copy of the filed SAR.
